I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/), advised by [Yue Li](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/yueli/) who co-runs the [PASCAL Research Group](https://pascal-lab.net/) with [Tian Tan](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/tiantan/).
I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Nanjing University in 2024.

My research focuses on developing program analysis techniques and tools for hardware description languages (HDLs), such as [Chisel](https://www.chisel-lang.org/) and [Verilog](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1620780).
